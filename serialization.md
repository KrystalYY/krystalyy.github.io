## Pickle in Python

Used for setialization and de-serialization of python objects, but it is not recommended to use if you want to use data across different programming languages, or different version of python.

## JSON

Language-independant, human readable, fast.

## XML

Poor performance.

##  Protocol Buffers

More efficient for communication and storage, supports RPC (procedure call).
